# LifeSync AI - Intelligent Lifestyle Recommendation System 🚀

### Powered by AMD Ryzen™ AI & AMD ROCm™

**LifeSync AI** is a unified, privacy-first recommendation engine designed to solve decision fatigue. Unlike fragmented apps, it aggregates movies, events, fashion, and travel into a single dashboard, using local edge computing to process user preferences securely.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Users today suffer from "App Fatigue," switching between 5-7 apps just to plan a weekend. Existing solutions lack cross-context intelligence (e.g., suggesting a raincoat when you book a monsoon trek). LifeSync AI solves this with a unified knowledge graph.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism UI), JavaScript
* **Backend:** PHP / Python (Flask)
* **Database:** MySQL
* **AI Acceleration (Core Innovation):**
    * **AMD Ryzen™ AI:** Utilizing the NPU for client-side inference to ensure zero-latency recommendations without cloud dependency.
    * **AMD ROCm™:** Used for optimizing the machine learning model training pipeline on AMD GPUs.

## ⚡ AMD Integration Strategy

This project is built with the **AMD "Edge-First" architecture**:
1.  **Privacy:** User behavioral data is processed locally on the device using the Ryzen AI NPU.
2.  **Performance:** Heavy ML tasks are offloaded to the AMD hardware, keeping the UI smooth.
3.  **Optimization:** Future iterations will implement deeper ROCm libraries for real-time collaborative filtering.

## 🚀 Key Features
* ✅ **Unified Dashboard:** Movies, Travel, Fashion in one place.
* ✅ **Context Aware:** Suggests products based on your event bookings.
* ✅ **Zero Latency:** Fast local processing.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
* Integration of **AMD Vitis™ AI** for vision-based fashion recommendations.
* Voice command support using local NLP models.
